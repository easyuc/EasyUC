# ucdsl-merge OLD NEW

# when ucdsl turns a .uc file into a .ec file, if there is already an
# OLD version of that file, we will use this script (possibly via
# system calls instead of literally using this script) to merge that
# OLD version with the NEWly generated one
#
# this is because the OLD .ec file will typically have a lot of
# *hand-generated code* that we don't want to lose; the user will have
# to go through the merged file, taking the old hand-generated code as
# a starting point, but discarding the superceded code
