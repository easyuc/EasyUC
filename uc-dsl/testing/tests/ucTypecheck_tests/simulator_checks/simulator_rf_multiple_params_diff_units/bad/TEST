description
  Simulator checking test in which simulated real functionality has
  two parameters from different units and so where the message paths
  won't be interchangeable.

  We've switched the message paths in one case so a path with
  parameter SMC1 is combined with a path for SMC2.
.
args: -I supporting SMC2.uc
outcome: failure
[error: SMC2.uc: from line 225 columns 14 to 44]

message path is not one of the possible outgoing message paths:
  SMC2IF_to_Sim.sim_rsp,
  SMC2Real.Fwd1.FwAdv.fw_obs,
  SMC2Real.Fwd2.FwAdv.fw_obs,
  SMC2Real.SMC1.SMC2Sima.sim_req,
  SMC2Real.SMC2.SMC2Simb.sim_req
.
