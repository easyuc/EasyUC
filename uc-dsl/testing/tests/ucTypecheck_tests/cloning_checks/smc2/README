We have the good version of the smc2 example, with a couple
unnatural changes to test features. And then various bad versions.

The unnatural changes are

(1) To make use of how Forwarding is implicitly UC required by
KeyExchange and SMC.

(2) To have a constant in a file EC cloned in Forwarding, that
is accessed in SMC2.
