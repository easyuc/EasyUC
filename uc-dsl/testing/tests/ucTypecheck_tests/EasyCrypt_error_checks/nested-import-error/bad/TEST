Test what happens when an EasyCrypt file being ec_required requires
another EC file with an error.

NOTE: we've fudged this test by making the file who.ec start with a
lowercase letter. When Goo.ec requires Who, the EasyCrypt code that we
run within ucdsl uses a Unix library function to figure out whether
the actual file is who.ec (first try) or Who.ec (second
try). Unfortuntely on macOS the first will succeed if the file is
Foo.ec, but on other Posix systems it would fail, and the file would
be correctly be identified as Who.ec. There doesn't seem to be a
simple way of making this code work correctly on macOS. By making
the file be who.ec, we'll get the same behavior on all Posix systems.
