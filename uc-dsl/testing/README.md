UC DSL Unit Testing Framework
====================================================================

This directory contains the implementation of a framework for carrying
out unit tests of the UC DSL tool, as well as a comprehensive suite of
unit tests.

The testing tool, `dsl-test`, is invoked with the name of a directory
containing unit tests. This directory hierarchy (the directory, its
subdirectories, their subdirectories, etc.) will be searched for unit
tests, which are then executed. When `dsl-test` is invoked, it will
describe its actions with levels of verbosity controlled by
command-line arguments (see below). It will also generate a log file,
`log`, in the current directory.

* Unit tests are directories containing a file `TEST` (see below for
  its structure). A unit test directory may also contain supporting
  `.uc` and `.ec` files, as well as subdirectories, all of which
  `dsl-test` ignores.

* `README` files in the directory hierarchy are ignored by
  `dsl-test`. These files begin with the six characters of `README`,
  in any case (even a mixture of lower- and uppercase). Occurrences of
  `log` are also ignored.

* Levels of the directory hierarchy above the unit testing directories
  may only contain `log` and `README` files, and subdirectories. A
  directory containing other files will be ignored (and flagged as an
  error).

Unit Test Directories
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A unit test directory contains a file `TEST`, along with supporting
`.uc` and `.ec` files, and optional subdirectories. `TEST` contains:

* an informal description of the test;

* the arguments that should be supplied to the `ucdsl` executable when
the test is run;

* the expected outcome of running `ucdsl` with those arguments.

Every `TEST` file has three fields: `description`, `args` and
`outcome`, which may come in any order.

Spaces and tabs may be freely inserted in `TEST` files. Newline
characters may be freely inserted as well, with a few exceptions
detailed below.  Comments may be freely inserted (with a few
exceptions, detailed below), and are equivalent to spaces (' ').
`(*` marks the beginning of a comment, and `*)` marks the comment's
end.  Nested comments are allowed.

### Description

As the name suggests, description should contain an informal
explanation of the purpose of the test.  This will be output and
logged by `dsl-test` in verbose mode only.  The syntax of the
description field is as follows:

```
description
The description of the test goes here. The symbols '(*', '*)' have no
special significance.  The description field ends with a line
consisting of only '.' ('.\n').
.
```

The text of the description field begins *after* (not including) the
newline terminating the line containing `description` and runs up to
and including the newline that precedes the terminating '`.`' (the
text does not include that '`.`').

### Args

The args field gives the arguments that will be supplied to `ucdsl`
when it is invoked. Its syntax is

```
args : <args>
```

where &lt;args&gt; consists of a sequence of words (nonempty sequences of
non-whitespace characters), separated by spaces or tabs. The args
field is terminated with a newline character.

E.g.,

```
args : -I foo goo.uc
```

says to run the command


```
ucdsl -I foo goo.ec
```

(which tells `ucdsl` to include the subdirectory `foo` on the
search path for `.uc` and `.ec` files).

### Outcome

The outcome field describes the expected outcome of running
the test. Its syntax is

```
outcome : <status>
...error...
or... warning...
messages...
.
```

where &lt;status&gt; is `success` (meaning `ucdsl` is expected to exit with
status 0) or `failure` (meaning `ucdsl` is expected to exit with a
nonzero status).

As with the description field, what comes after the
newline following &lt;status&gt; up to the newline preceding the line
consisting of only '`.`' is the text of the field. It should exactly
match (including occurrences of whitespace characters) the error and
warning messages output by `ucdsl`.

Here is an example outcome field:

```
outcome: failure
[error: testDuplicateMessageId.uc: from line 3 columns 5 to 6]

duplicate message name: m
.
```

This says that `ucdsl` is expected to exit with nonzero status, and
to issue the error message

```
[error: testDuplicateMessageId.uc: from line 3 columns 5 to 6]

duplicate message name: m
```

A test *passes* if and only if the exit status of `ucdsl` matches
the status of the outcome field *and* the messages issued by
`ucdsl` match the text of the outcome field.


Building the Testing Tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The source for the testing tool is in the subdirectory
`dsl-test-proj`.  To build `dsl-test` using the supplied `build` shell
script, simply issue the command:

```
build
```

You may want to add `/pathto/dsl-test` to your shell's search path.

Running the Testing Tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Before running `dsl-test`, you should ensure that `ucdsl` is on your
shell's search path.

The expected arguments to `dsl-test` are indicated by the following
usage message:

```
Usage: dsl-test [verbosity option] dir
       dsl-test -debug file
  -verbose Verbosity option: enables verbose mode
  -quiet Verbosity option: enables quiet mode
  -debug Prints debug information of a TEST file
  -help  Display this list of options
  --help  Display this list of options
```

To run `dsl-test` on &lt;dir-name&gt;, one executes one of the following
commands, depending on the desired degree of verbosity:

```
dsl-test <dir-name>
dsl-test -quiet <dir-name>
dsl-test -verbose <dir-name>
```

The `-quiet` option generates the log, `log`, in the current
directory, but is otherwise silent. The `-verbose` option outputs the
test descriptions provided by the `TEST` files both on the standard
output and in the log. The exit status of `dsl-test` tells you whether
all tests passed and no other error were encountered (an exit status
of 0 means yes, and a non-zero exit status means no).

### Conflict Files

When a unit test fails, a `CONFLICT` file is created in the test's
directory. Consult the `CONFLICT` file to see what the problem was.
When `ucdsl` issues messages that didn't match the text of the
test's outcome field, those messages are listed in the `CONFLICT`
file.

Resolving the conflict may involve updating the `TEST` file or
supporting `.uc` and `.ec` files, and/or changing `ucdsl` to fix a
bug. Once the conflict has been resolved, you must remove the
`CONFLICT` file (but see `dsl-test-suite`, below). When `dsl-test`
encounters a unit test directory with a `CONFLICT` file, it issues an
error message but otherwise ignores the unit test.

### Debug Option

To debug the syntax of a `TEST` file, you may use the `-debug`
option:

```
dsl-test -debug TEST
```

(replace `TEST` by another filename, as needed).

Examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectory `sample_tests' contains a few tests. To run these
tests simply use one of

```
dsl-test sample_tests
dsl-test -quiet sample_tests
dsl-test -verbose sample_tests
```

In all the cases, a log file with name `log` is created in the current
working directory.

The subdirectory `testing_tests` contains unit tests for `dsl-test`
itself.

Unit Test Suite
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The unit test suite for `ucdsl` is in the subdirectory [`tests`](tests).
To run `dsl-test` on the test suite, execute one of

```
./dsl-test-suite
./dsl-test-suite -quiet
./dsl-test-suite -verbose
```

depending upon what verbosity level you want `dsl-test` to employ.
`dsl-test-suite` removes all `log`, `.coverage` and `CONFLICT` files
before running `dsl-test`. When `dsl-test-suite` finishes, if `ucdsl`
was built with code coverage instrumentation, you can find the code
coverage report in the subdirectory `_coverage`; open `index.html`
with your web browser.

To remove all the `log`, `CONFLICT` and `.coverage` files, run the
command

```
./dsl-test-suite-cleanup
```
