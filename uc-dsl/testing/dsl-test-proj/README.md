UC DSL Unit Testing Framework Project
====================================================================

This directory contains the build scripts for the UC DSL testing
framework as well as its source (see the `src` directory).

To build the tool, run the command

```
build
```

which will create the `dsl-test` executable.

Running the command

```
build-cleanup
```

will remove the `_build` directory as well as the executable.
