(* Forwarding *)

(* Singleton unit consisting of a forwarding ideal functionality. The
   adversary is allowed to delay but not alter message forwarding. *)

(* we have no unit parameters - see, e.g., KeyExchange.uc to see how
   unit parameters can be specified *)

(* The basic direct interface for the single functionality party (because
   we won't have a real functionality, there is no reason not to use a
   single functionality party, to which forwarding requests come and from
   which forwarding responses originate).

   the identifiers in the @s and the parameter names are used in code
   generation and also useful when writing documentation. See below
   how they are used in message pattern matching and send and
   transition instructions. *)

direct FwDir' {
  in  pt1@fw_req(pt2 : port, u : univ)  (* message from pt1, requesting to send
    u to pt2 *)

  out fw_rsp(pt1 : port, u : univ)@pt2  (* message to pt2, saying that pt1
    sent u to it *)
}

(* The composite direct interface has a single component, corresponding to
   the single functionality party. *)

direct FwDir {D : FwDir'}

(* An ideal functionality must have a basic adversarial interface: *)

adversarial FwAdv {
  out fw_obs(pt1 : port, pt2 : port, u : univ)  (* inform adversary that
    pt1 wants to send u to pt2 *)

  in  fw_ok  (* adversary telling ideal functionality it can go ahead
    and send the universe value to its recipient *)
}

(* We say what direct (first) and adversarial (second) interfaces the
   functionality implements. This limits the possible messages
   coming/going from/to the environment and adversary. *)

           (which will be guaranteed to be an envport, i.e., not to
           point into the forwarder or adversary), and pt2 and u will
           get bound to the data of the fw_req message

           we need to explicitly check that pt2 doesn't point into
           forwarder or adversary *)
