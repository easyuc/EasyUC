If you run testing.uci from the shell, there is a pause between
the debugging message saying

trying to prove truth or falsity of:
adv <= (func, 1).`1 \/ adv <> (adv, 2).`1 \/ (adv, 2).`2 < 0

and the message

formula's negation proved

But in proof general the message come out - after the pause - at
once.
