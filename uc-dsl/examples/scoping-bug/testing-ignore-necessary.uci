(* this script shows that ucdsl_end_ignore must be used instead
   of ucdsl_end, when a load fails - and by extension it shows
   that when we undo loads, we must use ucdsl_end_ignore

   if you revert the client to using ucdsl_end, and type the
   following commands to ucdsl -interpreter, you'll see the bug
   (this can occur naturally if one runs through the second
   load (which fails), undos to functionality, and then runs
   the last three commands *)

load KeyExchange_no_T.
functionality KEReal.
real.
finish.
load KeyExchange_T_then_fails.  (* fails, but requires T *)
undo 1. (* back to functionality *)
functionality KEReal. (* fresh config based on current scope *)
var y : int.
assumption y_eq : y = T.x. (* but T.x does not exist in KeyExchange2 *)
