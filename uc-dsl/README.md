UC Domain Specific Language
====================================================================

This directory contains a prototype of the implementation of a domain
specific language (DSL) for expressing functionalities (protocols and
ideal functionalities) and simulators. The DSL will allow crypto
theorists to easily write and understand functionalities and
simulators.

The DSL design was driven by the expression of functionalities and
simulators in our EasyCrypt architecture for UC.  But it allows
expression at a much higher level, avoiding all the message-routing
boilerplate.

DSL type-checking will catch errors like badly formed messages (e.g.,
ones with bad source addresses) or simulators that interfere with
communication between environment and adversary. When DSL code is
translated into EasyCrypt's procedural programming language,
message-routing boilerplate will be automatically generated.

Some examples are in the [`examples`](examples) subdirectory,
including the files in the subdirectory
[`smc-case-study`](examples/smc-case-study), which contains the
definitions of the functionalities and simulators of our SMC (secure
message transmission) case study.

The OCaml code for a lexer, parser and typechecker for the DSL can be
found in the subdirectory [`src`](src). It builds upon the EasyCrypt
implementation, and is distributed under the same software license.
The software is still under development.  A translator into EasyCrypt
is yet to be written.

Building the UC DSL Tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions assume you have already installed
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org), the OCaml Package Manager
[`opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org), [OCaml
Batteries](https://ocaml-batteries-team.github.io/batteries-included/hdoc2/),
[EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt), and the
`Bisect_ppx` plugin for Ocamlbuild
[Bisect_ppx](https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild).
(OCaml Batteries can be installed using `opam`: `opam install
batteries`.  Bisect_ppx can be installed using `opam`: `opam install
bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild`.) EasyCrypt can be installed via `opam` or by
building from the source; see the
[instructions](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt).

The UC DSL source is compatible with `why3` (installed as part
of the EasyCrypt installation) version 1.4.0.

To build the UC DSL tool `ucdsl`, first configure the tool by running

```
./configure
```

telling it the full pathname of the EasyCrypt `theories` directory.

Next, run

```
./build
```

to build the tool and copy the binary to `bin/ucdsl`.

Alternatively, run

```
./build-coverage
```

to build the tool with code coverage instrumentation turned on
and copy the binary to `bin/ucdsl`.

To clean up the build state, you can run

```
./build-cleanup
```

(If you get to a state where `ocamlbuild` is complaining, running
`./build-cleanup` and then `./build` often fixes the problem.)

You may want to add `/pathto/bin/ucdsl` to your shell's search path.  Run
`ucdsl -help` for information about how to invoke the tool.

To edit the source in Emacs, you'll want to install the following
`opam` packages:

```
opam install tuareg
opam install merlin
```

You'll also want to install the following Emacs packages, using the Emacs
package manager, [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/).  If you haven't
already added

```
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
```

to your `.emacs` customization file, you should do so. In Emacs, run
`package-refresh-contents`, and then use `package-install` to install
`tuareg`, `autocomplete` and `merlin`.

Finally, add

```
(require 'merlin)

(autoload 'merlin-mode "merlin" nil t nil)
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
```

to your `.emacs` file.

Emacs Major Mode for Editing UC DSL Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the [`emacs`](emacs) subdirectory, there is a simple
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) major mode for editing UC
DSL (`.uc`) files. Copy the file `ucdsl-mode.el` to Emacs's
`site-lisp` directory, and put the code

```
(require 'ucdsl-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.uc\\'" . ucdsl-mode))
```

in your Emacs initialization file (typically `.emacs` in your
home directory).

The major mode provides simple syntax highlighting. To run the
`ucdsl` command on a `.uc` file, run `M-x compile`. `M-x next-error`
(bound to ``C-x` ``) takes you to the next error in the `*compilation*`
buffer, showing you the location of the error in your source file.

Unit Testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectory [`testing`](testing) contains a unit testing
framework, including a suite of test cases. This suite can
be used to check code coverage (see the above instructions for
building `ucdsl` with code coverage instrumentation turned on).

Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The file:

* `.merlin` contains the configuration file for
  [Merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin), a plugin to `emacs` and
  `vim` for assisting in the editing of OCaml code (e.g., learning the
  types of expressions).

* `_tags` contains the `ocamlbuild` tags for the project (`ocamlbuild`
  is used by the `build` script).

* `myocamlbuild.ml` is the project's `ocamlbuild` plugin, customizing
  its behavior.
